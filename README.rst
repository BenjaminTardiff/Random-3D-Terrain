PyTerrain
#########

PyTerrain is a program for generating random terrains using noise and various parameters such as frequency and amplitude of layers of noise.

The graphics run on my pyEngine3D module which can also be found on my github page.

Current features:

- Generate and render random terrain using perlin noise.

- Visualisation features of pyEngine3D (drag to rotate, zoom, etc.).

Future features:

- Terrain generation with simplex and other noises
